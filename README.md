# Episo-quantify Epitranscriptomal RNA m5c at isoform level
Episo is a probabilistic model to quantify Epitranscriptomal RNA m5C at the transcript isoform level. Episo consists of three tools, named mapper, quant and Bisulfitefq, for mapping, quantifying, and simulating RNA-BisSeq data, respectively. Episo needs a working version of Perl and it is run from the command line. Meanwhile, Bowtie, Tophat and Cufflinks need to be installed on your computer. First you need to download a transcript annotation file from the Ensembl or NCBI websites. Episo supports the reference trancriptom sequence files in FastA format, allowed file extensions are either .fa or .fasta. The details see the document Episo_User_Guide.pdf.
